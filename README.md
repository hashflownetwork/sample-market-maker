# Hashflow: Sample Market Maker

This example repo showcases an example market maker which connects to the [**Hashflow**](hashflow.com) API via WebSocket and implements all required functionality.

If you want to build your MM based on this foundation, simply go through all `// TODO` statements in the codebase and replace them with your own logic.

## Using
Install all necessary requirements by running
```
$ yarn
```

Then, you can run the example file with 
```
$ yarn start:mm
```
